This is an app to put what you know about Nested Attributes into effect,
Its an app that tracks a garden full of flowerpots. Every flowerpot has a plant, every plant has a flower.

Theres are all embedded relations, your challenge is to set up just one controller Flowerpots Controller, and one form, flowerpots/new.html.erb that lets me create the entire package.


###Steps

* Check out the fields that the models have, and try creating all of the models in rails console before you even touch a controller file.
* Find out what needs to accept nested attributes for what.

* Implement the #new action
* make the form work with that

* make the #create action

* Make the main index page list all the data.

* Your controller #create action can only be one line
